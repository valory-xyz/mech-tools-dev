# mech-tools-dev

This repository implements the core logic of Mech and is the reference repository for developers to streamline the development 
and testing of tools and their integration to a Mech.

In order to do so, always fork this repository first and clone the forked copy. This can be done as follows: 

```bash
gh repo fork https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-tools-dev --clone=true
```

Then follow the instructions below. 

## Adding a tool to the repository

**Requirements**:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) `>= 3.10`
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) `>=1.4.0` 

In order to create a tool, the steps are as follows: 

**1.** Install the dependencies, set up a remote registry, and fetch the third-party packages from IPFS.
You may use the following command after replacing the value for the `AUTHORNAME` variable:

```bash
AUTHORNAME=author

cd mech && \
poetry install && \
poetry run autonomy init --remote --ipfs --author $AUTHORNAME && \
poetry run autonomy packages sync --update-packages
```

**2.** Create the tool's structure by using the following command, after replacing the values for the `AUTHORNAME` and `TOOL_NAME` variables:

```bash
AUTHORNAME=author
TOOL_NAME=tool_name

TOOL_PATH=packages/"$AUTHORNAME"/customs/"$TOOL_NAME"
YEAR=$(date +"%Y")

mkdir -p $TOOL_PATH && \
cat > $TOOL_PATH/component.yaml <<EOF
name: $TOOL_NAME
author: $AUTHORNAME
version: 0.1.0
type: custom
description: Tool description
license: Apache-2.0
aea_version: '>=1.0.0, <2.0.0'
fingerprint:
    __init__.py:
    $TOOL_NAME.py:
fingerprint_ignore_patterns: []
entry_point: $TOOL_NAME.py
callable: run
dependencies: {}
EOF

for file in __init__.py "$TOOL_NAME.py"; do
  cat > $TOOL_PATH/$file <<EOF

EOF
done

cat >> "$TOOL_PATH/$TOOL_NAME.py" <<EOF
"""The implementation of the $TOOL_NAME tool."""


def run(*args, **kwargs):
    """The callable for the $TOOL_NAME tool."""
    # TODO: Implement the tool logic
    print(f"Running $TOOL_NAME with {args=} and {kwargs=}.")

EOF

poetry run autonomy packages lock
```

This command will generate the following structure, with template code:

```
packages/  
 ├── authorname/  
 │   ├── customs/  
 │   │   ├── tool_name/  
 │   │   │   ├── component.yaml
 │   │   │   ├── tool_name.py
 │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
```

**3.** Now that your tool's structure is set up, 
all that's left is to configure the tool component and implement the tool's functionality in Python.
The `component.yaml` file contains the tool's configuration. 
Here is an explanation of its fields:
- name: the name of the tool.
- author: the author's name.
- version: the version of the tool.
- type: the component type of the `open-autonomy` framework. This should be `custom`.
- description: the description of the tool.
- license: the licencing of the tool. It should be Apache-2.0.
- aea_version: the supported `open-aea` version.
- fingerprint: unique hash of the tool. This is auto-generated by the framework's `autonomy packages lock` command.
- fingerprint_ignore_patterns: ignore patterns for the fingerprint's generation.
- entry_point: the module which contains the tool's implementation.
- callable: points to the function which is called in the tool's module.
- dependencies: the module's dependencies. You may specify them in the following format:

```
dependencies:
    dependency_1:
        version: ==0.5.3
    dependency_2:
        version: '>=2.20.0'
```

**4.** Add the tool to the list of packages, in the file `packages/packages.json`: 

```bash 
autonomy packages lock
```

When prompted, choose `dev`.

Then push the tool package to IPFS using the following: 

```bash
autonomy push-all
```

**5.** Add the tool's dependencies to the list of dependencies in the file `packages/valory/agents/mech/aea-config.yaml`.

**6.** In the file `packages/valory/services/mech/service.yaml`, change the value of the key `agent` to the hash for `agent/valory/mech/0.1.0` found in `packages/packages.json`.

**7.** Push to the origin.

## Testing the tool

In order to test a tool, you can use the [quickstart](https://github.com/valory-xyz/quickstart/). You will need the hashes of your tools found in `packages/packages.json` and the service hash (corresponding to the key `service/valory/mech/0.1.0` in the same file).
