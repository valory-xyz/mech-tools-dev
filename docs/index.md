## **Mechs**

> **Note:** The codebase uses the term *service* (from the underlying Open Autonomy framework) interchangeably with *AI agent*.

Mechs are Olas AI agents that provide on-chain services to other AI agents in exchange for small payments.
They allow agents to access a wide range of tools—such as LLM subscriptions or prediction services—without the need to implement ad-hoc integrations.
All interactions with Mechs happen through a common API using on-chain requests and responses, enabling agents to access multiple tools via a unified interface.

You can think of Mechs as subscription-free tool libraries with a standard interface. Each Mech can offer multiple tools.
Anyone can create and deploy their own Mechs and register them in the Olas Registry. Once registered, a Mech contract can be created via the Mech Marketplace.


## **The Mech Marketplace**

The Mech Marketplace is a collection of smart contracts that facilitate seamless, on-chain interactions between requesters (agents or applications) and Mech agents providing task-based services.
It acts as a relay, ensuring secure payments and efficient task execution.
Specifically, the Mech Marketplace enables:

- **Effortless Mech Deployment**
Any AI agent registered in the Olas Registry can deploy a Mech contract with minimal inputs, allowing rapid tool offering and on-chain payment collection.

- **Seamless Task Requests**
Requesters can submit service requests directly through the Mech Marketplace. On-chain contracts handle payments and service delivery transparently between requesters and Mechs.

- **Guaranteed Task Completion**
If a designated Mech fails to respond within the requester's specified deadline, a take-over mechanism allows other available Mechs to complete the task, ensuring high reliability and fulfillment rates.

- **Karma Reputation System**
Each Mech's performance is tracked via the Karma contract, which maintains a reputation score based on successful task completions and failures. High Karma scores signal trustworthiness to requesters under honest participation assumptions.

- **A Competitive Environment**
Mechs are incentivized to complete tasks promptly and reliably to maintain high Karma scores, improving their chances of receiving more tasks over time.

Through Mechs and the Mech Marketplace, agents in the Olas ecosystem gain modular, on-chain access to advanced tooling without managing subscriptions or complex integrations, supporting scalable and decentralized agent economies.


## Payment models

When creating a Mech, deployers can select between the following payment models:

- **Native**: a fixed-price model where the requester pays using the chain's native token for each delivered service.

- **Token**: similar to the Native model, but payments are made using a specified ERC20 token.

- **Nevermined subscription native**: a dynamic pricing model that allows flexible pricing across different services with native token.

- **Nevermined subscription token**: a dynamic pricing model that allows flexible pricing across different services using a specified ERC20 token.


## Supported chains

| Chain | Native | OLAS Token | USDC Token | Nevermined |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Gnosis | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Base | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Polygon | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Optimism | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |


## How the request-response flow works

Here's a simplified version of the mech request-response:

![Mech flow](imgs/mech.png)

1. Write request data: the requester writes the request data to IPFS. The request data must contain the attributes `nonce`, `tool`, and `prompt`. Additional attributes can be passed depending on the specific tool:

    ```json
    {
      "nonce": 15,
      "tool": "prediction_request",
      "prompt": "Will my favourite football team win this week's match?"
    }
    ```

2. The application gets the request data IPFS hash from the IPFS node.

3. The application writes the request's IPFS hash to the Mech Marketplace contract, including a small payment. Alternatively, the payment could be done separately through a Nevermined subscription.

4. The Mech AI agent is constantly monitoring request events, and therefore gets the request hash.

5. The Mech reads the request data from IPFS using its hash.

6. The Mech selects the appropriate tool to handle the request from the `tool` entry in the metadata, and runs the tool with the given arguments, usually a prompt.

7. The Mech gets a response from the tool.

8. The Mech writes the response to IPFS.

9. The Mech receives the response IPFS hash.

10. The Mech writes the response hash to the Mech Marketplace contract.

11. The requester monitors for response events and reads the response hash from the associated transaction.

12. The application gets the response metadata from IPFS:

    ```json
    {
      "requestId": 68039248068127180134548324138158983719531519331279563637951550269130775,
      "result": "{\"p_yes\": 0.35, \"p_no\": 0.65, \"confidence\": 0.85, \"info_utility\": 0.75}"
    }
    ```

See some examples of requests and responses on the [Mech Hub](https://mech.olas.network/gnosis/mech/0x77af31de935740567cf4ff1986d04b2c964a786a?legacy=true).


## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) `>=3.10, <3.12`
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for the "From source" path only)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) + [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## Quick start

### Quickstart (installed package)

```bash
pip install mech-server
mech setup -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
# edit ~/.operate-mech/.env and set your API keys
mech run -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
mech stop -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
```

`mech setup` auto-bootstraps the default workspace at `~/.operate-mech/` if it does not exist yet.

### From source

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-server.git
    cd mech-server/
    ```

2. Install all Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Download all the mech packages from IPFS:
    ```bash
    autonomy packages sync --update-packages
    ```

4. Run the setup command:
    ```bash
    mech setup -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
    ```

    You will be prompted to fill in some details, including the RPC for your chosen chain. You can get one from a provider like [Quiknode](https://www.quicknode.com/) but we encourage you to first test against a virtual network using [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/). This way, you can also use the faucet to fund the required wallets.


## Creating and running a Mech with custom tools

This section walks through creating a custom tool, publishing it, and running your Mech.

### 1. Set up the workspace

Before adding tools, you need a workspace. Run setup once:

```bash
mech setup -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
```

This creates the workspace at `~/.operate-mech/`, builds the agent, deploys a mech on the marketplace, and configures keys and environment.

### 2. Scaffold a tool

```bash
mech add-tool AUTHOR_NAME TOOL_NAME -d "My tool description"
```

This generates the following structure:

```
~/.operate-mech/packages/
 └── AUTHOR_NAME/
     └── customs/
         └── TOOL_NAME/
             ├── component.yaml
             ├── TOOL_NAME.py
             └── __init__.py
```

### 3. Configure and implement the tool

**`component.yaml`** — review and update:

- `name`: the name of the tool.
- `author`: the author's name.
- `version`: the version of the tool.
- `type`: the component type. Should be `custom`.
- `description`: the description of the tool.
- `license`: should be `Apache-2.0`.
- `aea_version`: the supported `open-aea` version.
- `fingerprint`: auto-generated by `mech prepare-metadata`.
- `entry_point`: the module containing the tool's implementation.
- `callable`: the function called in the entry point module.
- `dependencies`: the tool's Python dependencies, for example:

```yaml
dependencies:
    dependency_1:
        version: ==0.5.3
    dependency_2:
        version: '>=2.20.0'
```

**`TOOL_NAME.py`** — implement the tool logic. The scaffold generates a working stub with the correct structure:

```python
ALLOWED_TOOLS = ["tool_name"]

MechResponse = Tuple[str, Optional[str], Optional[Dict[str, Any]], Any, Any]

def error_response(msg: str) -> MechResponse:
    """Return an error mech response."""
    return msg, None, None, None, None

def run(**kwargs: Any) -> MechResponse:
    """Run the tool."""
    prompt = kwargs.get("prompt")
    if prompt is None:
        return error_response("No prompt has been given.")
    result = do_work(prompt)
    return result, prompt, None, None, None
```

Key points:

- `ALLOWED_TOOLS` must list the tool name exactly as it appears in requests.
- `run()` must return a 5-tuple `(result, prompt, context, extra, extra)`.
- The first element is the tool's response (typically a string or JSON string).
- The second element is the original prompt.

### 4. Configure the offchain URL

In addition to on-chain requests, a mech can serve off-chain requests over HTTP. If you want to enable off-chain requests, provide a URL that routes to your mech's HTTP server (which binds to `localhost:8000`). This URL is included in the mech's on-chain metadata so that clients can discover it.

Set the URL by passing `--offchain-url` to `prepare-metadata`:

```bash
mech prepare-metadata -c gnosis --offchain-url <url>
```

Alternatively, set the `MECH_OFFCHAIN_URL` variable in the chain `.env` file and run `prepare-metadata` without the flag:

```bash
# ~/.operate-mech/.env.gnosis
MECH_OFFCHAIN_URL=<url>
```

```bash
mech prepare-metadata -c gnosis
```

The CLI persists the URL to `MECH_OFFCHAIN_URL` in the chain `.env` file and includes it in the generated `metadata.json` under the `"url"` field. If no URL is configured, the field defaults to empty.

### 5. Publish metadata and update on-chain

Once your tool is implemented, publish everything with a single command:

```bash
mech prepare-metadata -c gnosis
```

This command handles the full publish pipeline:

1. Locks package hashes (re-computes fingerprints after your edits)
2. Pushes all packages to IPFS
3. Generates `metadata.json` from your tool definitions
4. Publishes metadata to IPFS
5. Writes `METADATA_HASH` and `TOOLS_TO_PACKAGE_HASH` to `.env`

Then update the on-chain metadata hash:

```bash
mech update-metadata -c gnosis
```

### 6. Run your Mech

```bash
mech run -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
```

### 7. Send a request

1. Get your Mech's address from the workspace `.env`:
    ```bash
    grep MECH_TO_CONFIG ~/.operate-mech/.env
    ```

2. Send the request:
    ```bash
    mechx request --prompts <your_prompt> --priority-mech <your_mech_address> --tools <your_tool_name> --chain-config <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
    ```

3. Wait for the response. If there's an error in the tool, you will see it in the Mech's logs.

### 8. Stop your Mech

```bash
mech stop -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
```


## Adding tools to an existing Mech

If your Mech is already running and you want to add or update tools:

1. Stop the running service:
    ```bash
    mech stop -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
    ```

2. Scaffold and implement your new tool (same as steps 2-3 above).

3. Publish the updated metadata and update the on-chain registry:
    ```bash
    mech prepare-metadata -c <chain>
    mech update-metadata -c <chain>
    ```

4. Restart your Mech:
    ```bash
    mech run -c <gnosis|base|polygon|optimism>
    ```


## Minting a tool on the Olas Registry

To register your tool as a component on the Olas Registry, mint it [here](https://marketplace.olas.network/ethereum/components/mint).

You will need an address (EOA) and the hash of the metadata file.
Click on "Generate Hash & File" and provide:

- name (name of the tool)
- description (of the tool)
- version (must match the version in `component.yaml`)
- package hash (found in `packages/packages.json`)
- Optionally, an NFT image URL. To push an image to IPFS:

```bash
mechx push-to-ipfs ./<file_name>
```
