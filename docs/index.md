## **Overview** 

This guide explains how to contribute to the Mech ecosystem by developing and offering services. Anyone can offer services by creating and deploying their own Mech agents. The process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Tool development**: Developers can either reuse existing tools (modular components of Mechs) or create and publish new ones.

2. **Agent deployment**: Once the necessary tools are ready, a Mech agent can be deployed and registered on the Olas Registry.

3. **Contract creation**: A Mech contract can then be created via the [Mech Marketplace](#appendix-what-is-the-mech-marketplace). When doing so, developers must choose a payment model that determines how requesters will pay for services.

There are three available payment models:

- **Native**: A fixed-price model where the requester pays in the chain’s native token for each delivered service.

- **Token**: Similar to the Native model, but payments are made using a specified ERC20 token.

- **Nevermined subscription**: A dynamic pricing model that enables flexible pricing and access to multiple services through a single subscription.

Detailed instructions for creating tools, testing them locally, deploying Mech agents, and receiving payments are provided below.
 
## 1. Creating and publishing a tool

In order to contribute to Mechs' abilities, you can create and publish a tool. In order to do so, follow the instructions below. 

**Requirements**:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) `>= 3.10`
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) `>=1.4.0` 

### 1. 1. Creating a tool

In order to create a tool, the steps are as follows: 

**1.** Fork and clone the [mech-tools-dev](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-tools-dev) repository. 

- Option 1: Fork the repository from the GitHub page. Then, clone your fork using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mech-tools-dev.git
```

- Option 2: To clone and fork in a single command, you can use Github's CLI tools:

```bash
gh repo fork https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-tools-dev --clone=true
```

**2.** Install the dependencies, set up a remote registry, and fetch the third-party packages from IPFS.
You may use the following command after replacing the value for the `AUTHORNAME` variable:

```bash
AUTHORNAME=author

cd mech-tools-dev && \
poetry install && \
poetry run autonomy init --remote --ipfs --author $AUTHORNAME && \
poetry run autonomy packages sync --update-packages
```

**3.** Create the tool's structure by using the following command, after replacing the values for the `AUTHORNAME` and `TOOL_NAME` variables:

```bash
AUTHORNAME=author
TOOL_NAME=tool_name

TOOL_PATH=packages/"$AUTHORNAME"/customs/"$TOOL_NAME"
YEAR=$(date +"%Y")

mkdir -p $TOOL_PATH && \
cat > $TOOL_PATH/component.yaml <<EOF
name: $TOOL_NAME
author: $AUTHORNAME
version: 0.1.0
type: custom
description: Tool description
license: Apache-2.0
aea_version: '>=1.0.0, <2.0.0'
fingerprint:
    __init__.py:
    $TOOL_NAME.py:
fingerprint_ignore_patterns: []
entry_point: $TOOL_NAME.py
callable: run
dependencies: {}
EOF

for file in __init__.py "$TOOL_NAME.py"; do
  cat > $TOOL_PATH/$file <<EOF

EOF
done

cat >> "$TOOL_PATH/$TOOL_NAME.py" <<EOF
"""The implementation of the $TOOL_NAME tool."""


def run(*args, **kwargs):
    """The callable for the $TOOL_NAME tool."""
    # TODO: Implement the tool logic
    print(f"Running $TOOL_NAME with {args=} and {kwargs=}.")

EOF

poetry run autonomy packages lock
```

This command will generate the following structure, with template code:

```
packages/  
 ├── authorname/  
 │   ├── customs/  
 │   │   ├── tool_name/  
 │   │   │   ├── component.yaml
 │   │   │   ├── tool_name.py
 │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
```

**4.** Now that your tool's structure is set up, 
all that's left is to configure the tool component and implement the tool's functionality in Python.
The `component.yaml` file contains the tool's configuration. 
Here is an explanation of its fields:
- name: the name of the tool.
- author: the author's name.
- version: the version of the tool.
- type: the component type of the `open-autonomy` framework. This should be `custom`.
- description: the description of the tool.
- license: the licencing of the tool. It should be Apache-2.0.
- aea_version: the supported `open-aea` version.
- fingerprint: unique hash of the tool. This is auto-generated by the framework's `autonomy packages lock` command.
- fingerprint_ignore_patterns: ignore patterns for the fingerprint's generation.
- entry_point: the module which contains the tool's implementation.
- callable: points to the function which is called in the tool's module.
- dependencies: the module's dependencies. You may specify them in the following format:

```
dependencies:
    dependency_1:
        version: ==0.5.3
    dependency_2:
        version: '>=2.20.0'
```

### 1. 2. Publishing the tool

Before proceeding, make sure that you are inside the poetry environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

**1.** Create the package hash, by running the following commands, from the root:

```bash
autonomy packages lock
```

At this point you will be prompted to choose "dev" or "third-part". Choose "dev".

**2.** Push the packages to IPFS: 

```bash
autonomy push-all
```

After this the tool can be deployed to be used by a [Mech](#2-running-a-mech-locally). 


## 2. Running a Mech locally

In order to deploy a Mech agent, register it on the Mech Marketplace and run it locally in order to test your tools, you can use the [quickstart](https://github.com/valory-xyz/quickstart/blob/main/README.md).

## 3. Minting the tool

Once a definitive version of the tool is ready, in order to receive dev rewards, you can mint the tool as a component on the Olas Registry. For this, go to the [Olas Registry](https://registry.olas.network/ethereum/components/mint). You need a funded address (EOA) to enter in the field "Owner address". In order to create the hash of the meta-data file, click on “Generate Hash & File” and provide the following information: 

- name (of the tool); 
- description (of the tool); 
- version (this needs to match the version in the file `component.yaml`); 
- package hash (this can be found in `packages.json` under the `packages` folder); 
- [Optional] NFT image URL (for instance on IPFS, supported domains are listed in the window). In order to push an image on IPFS, there are two options: 

- Use this [script](https://github.com/dvilelaf/tsunami/blob/v0.9.0/scripts/ipfs_pin.py). 
   Place the image in a folder called `mints` in `.jpg` format. 
   Then, run the script:
```bash
python ipfs_pin.py
```

- Use the [mech-client](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-client.git), 
   replacing `<file_name>` with the name of your file:
```bash
poetry add mech-client &&\
mechx push-to-ipfs ./<file_name>
```

You will see the hash in the logs. 

## Appendix : What is the Mech Marketplace ?

The Mech Marketplace is a collection of smart contracts designed to facilitate seamless interactions between agents or applications (referred to as requesters) and Mech agents which provide task-based services. Essentially, it acts as a relay, enabling secure, on-chain payments while ensuring efficient task requests and service delivery. 

Specifically, the Mech Marketplace enables the following.

- **Effortless Mech contract creation and delivery**: Any agent registered on the Olas Service registry can quickly deploy a Mech contract with minimal inputs. This streamlined process allows agents to rapidly offer their service and receive on-chain payments.

- **Seamless task execution requests**: Requesters—whether agents or applications—can opt to directly submit service requests through the Mech Marketplace. The on-chain contracts manage payments, ensuring a smooth and transparent interaction between requesters and Mech agents.

- **Guaranteed task completion**: A take-over mechanism is in place: if a designated Mech fails to respond within a deadline specified by the requester, any other available Mech can step in to complete the task. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that every request is fulfilled, maintaining the system’s reliability.
Karma - A reputation score system: The Karma contract tracks each Mech’s performance by maintaining a reputation score. This reflects how often a Mech successfully completes assigned tasks versus how often it fails. Mech agents that maintain high Karma scores are considered more trustworthy by requesters. Assuming honest participation, Mech agents that maintain high Karma scores are considered more trustworthy by requesters.

- **Competitive environment**: Mechs are incentivized to deliver outstanding results promptly in order to maintain high Karma scores and secure more tasks.
