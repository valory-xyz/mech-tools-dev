{research['factors']}

3. Relevant Dates and Timelines:
{research['dates']}

4. Alternative Scenarios:

For price predictions, your response MUST include specific price ranges. Even with low confidence, provide your best estimate based on the available data.

Provide your analysis in this format:

MAIN PREDICTION:
[For prices: Specific price range with timeframe, e.g., "$X to $Y by [date]" with probability]
[For other questions: Clear prediction with probability range]

KEY FACTORS DRIVING THIS PREDICTION:
- [Most important factor]
- [Second most important factor]
- [Third most important factor]

PRICE SCENARIOS (for price predictions):
1. Optimistic Case: $[price] (probability: X%) - [key drivers]
2. Base Case: $[price] (probability: Y%) - [key drivers]
3. Pessimistic Case: $[price] (probability: Z%) - [key drivers]

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS (for non-price predictions):
1. Optimistic Case (probability): [description]
2. Base Case (probability): [description]
3. Pessimistic Case (probability): [description]

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: [1-10]
[If confidence is low (1-4), explain why but still provide specific predictions]

TIME HORIZON: [Specific timeframe for the prediction]

CRITICAL UNCERTAINTIES:
- [Key risk factor 1]
- [Key risk factor 2]
- [Key risk factor 3]"""
